<p>
  Entering LPSci for grade 9, I felt a bit of uncertainty as for what this next grade would be for the entire school year.
  Unlike the previous times where I already had expectations and goals set for the upcoming grade, 
  I spent most of my time to not only be at peace during vacation, 
  but also focus more on taking care of myself to prepare for yet another routine of weekly classes with short breaks in between.
<br><br>
  Although I did not worry too much about what 1st quarter was gonna bring, 
  I was and still am certainly shocked at how it turned out. For one, 
  I was pleasantly surprised to meet <b>Ms. Uminga</b> first-hand at class.
  From short accounts I've heard of people, I assumed a kind, laid-back, and reserved soul that brings wisdom to the class every now and then when she has the chance.
  However, that doesn't mean that the true person she is isn't just as wonderful.
  <br>
  To be forgiving and time-considerate to students is amazing.
  To be engaging, fun, but also hold authority towards the class is spectacular.
  But to be both and also be respected as a soulful teacher? 
  That takes a level of diligence, patience, and humility that most dream to become. Truly, Ms. Uminga is an incredible, capable soul whom I aspire to learn from more throughout the next three quarters.
  <br><br>
  As for the performance tasks, class projects, and general experiences that I encountered during <b>1st quarter</b>,
  I am glad to say that all went smooth for the most part. I ran into looming roadblocks that I eventually overcame,
  disputes that stirred unwanted issues, wifi problems that made me lose all hope for PLDT,
  and tantrums I caused over problems I barely had control over. But through the thick of it all,
  it was inevitably those situations and my decisions that got me here today, still standing strong.
  <br>
  Shout out to all my few friends and lovely family! They have definitely been a part of aiding me through my worst,
  And they deserve the recognition for the kind support they have so graciously gave, 
  No matter how flawed or imperfect they are. Without them, I wouldn't be so sure I'd be in as much of a great state as I am right now.
  <br><br>
  <b>Ultimately</b>, this 1st quarter has been the most confusing, yet powerful 2 months that I have yet to understand.
  Maybe it's all in my head, or perhaps it's something more. In such a short span of time, lots of memorable moments happened,
  and it had me rethink the mundane vision that I thought it would be. Maybe after all more will be coming this school year.
  Maybe this will be just as much, if not more impactful to my life than it would seem, 
  Maybe this time, I will push through once more, and better than ever before.
